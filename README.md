# A Reservation-System as our final project for Programming I
-This is a reservation system made in Java using Java swing

-We can perform CRUD operations on it, to schedule or add reservation for Hotel rooms or restaurant.

-It has a login for security authentication.

-We used JDBC for the database connection to perform the CRUD operations directly on the database.

-Used NetBeans as our IDE for its development.
